          Currently, I am enrolled in UofT Coding Bootcamp which provides
          extensive training in fullstack webdevelopment technology. I recently
          graduated from George Brown College where I obtained various forms of
          computer programming languages, as well as in the applied and
          theoretical aspects of computer hardware and networking. I have
          thoroughly benefitted from the instructive challenges that George
          Brown’s School of Computer Technology has afforded. More importantly,
          through the combination of training at George Brown’s state-of-the-art
          computer laboratories, I have acquired hands-on experience in all
          aspects of computer programming including, professional
          communications, administrative duties and computer hardware and
          networking. Throughout my practical and academic courses at George
          Brown, I consistently displayed both an aptitude and an enthusiasm for
          the task at hand.
